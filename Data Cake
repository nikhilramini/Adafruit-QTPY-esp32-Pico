Website Name: DATACAKE
First you need to have your gateways and applications configured in THE THINGS NETWORK
Go to Datacake and create a new account, creating account is free.
Once you login you will see your workspace there will be no devices on your workspace
To add a device click the + Add Device button 
Here you need to select your device and model
My manifacturer is Seeed and the device I am using is SenseCAP S2105 Sensor
Click next, now select the network I am using THE THINGS NETWORK, If you are using any other network you can select the network you are using
Now, enter the DEV EUI (DEV EUI of your sensor or application) and give a name to your device
Click next, basically this DATACAKE supports upto 5 free devices, so select on free when it asks for payment options
Now we can see the dashboard but the misiing thing is the data that is sent from device, so now we need to bring that on DATACAKE
First, we need to create a token in DATACAKE which we can use in THE THINGS NETWORK 
To create a token go to members section on the sidebar, Click on API usres and create a API user by clicking on Add API User
Give a name for your token and click on Add permission for all Devices in Workspace and now check mark the can record measurements option
This means the token is allowed to record data on your device
Click save and your token is created
Now, copy the token and go to THE THINGS NETWORK on the side bar click on the integrations section
Click on Weebhooks option and click on + Add Webhook
Now select DATACAKE and give an ID and paste the token you copied and click on create datacake webhook
It is pending because no data has been forwarded
Go to DATACAKE website and send a data packet from your device now you will see the data on the dashboard
In DATACAKE we also have a Debug section to troubleshoot the integration it tells us what is going to on
In DATACAKE there is also an option to send downlinks from datacake to the device to configure things like transmission intervals
But, right now the configuration has not been done to send downlinks to device
To enable downlinks go to configuration section and scroll down until you find the LoRaWAN section
Here you can see the downlinks are not configured, to do that click on change
Now, enter the Dev ID which can be found in THE THINGS NETWORK, now we need to enter the server url which is the url from THE THINGS NETWORK
but copy only the first element for ex copy us1.cloud.thethings.network
Now we need to provide TTN Application Id which can be found in the Overview of the application in THE THINGS NETWORK
Now we need to create an API key, this step is to authenticate DATACAKE to your devices
Go to TTN, on side click on API keys and create one, give it a name and select Grant all current and future rights and click on create API key
Now you need to copy the API key which you can do only once, Once you click I have copied the key, you can't access the key again
So make sure you copy the key correctly
Go back to datacake and paste the key and click update and now we are set to send the downlinks.
