# Product Description
Product Name: Raspberry Pi 3 
Product Description: The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the third generation Raspberry Pi. 
This powerful credit-card sized single board computer can be used for many applications and supersedes the original Raspberry Pi Model B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. 
Whilst maintaining the popular board format the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B brings you a more powerful processer, 10x faster than the first generation Raspberry Pi. 
Additionally it adds wireless LAN & Bluetooth connectivity making it the ideal solution for powerful connected designs.

For configuring the Pi follow this link [Configuration](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html)

Begin with the raspberry OS installation. Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager. 
Use this link to https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ (or) https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/ download
Open the raspberry pi imager application select choose device and select the device you are using(select the model). 
Choose the OS, choose storage(sd card). You can also edit the settings like username and password
(You can also change them later through command line using sudo raspi-config command, but it's better to change here). 
Set the locale settings(adding time zone), now flash the os into sd card.
Now you can fix the parts. You need to insert SD card after seeting up the equipment.
For detailed information on how to fix the parts use this link https://youtu.be/DdnzSmJ5Fxg?si=YDYS_Bi70eTiWGiy. Note: This is reference for setting up the parts.

Check the description of the videos for the github links.

Once you log in to the raspberry desktop you can use the comand sudo raspi-config to make changes to password or to set time zone and language.
As we are in US we need to select en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
On next selct screen select en_US.UTF-8. Now reboot to make the changes reflect.
df -h command gives info about the sd card storage
To increase the storage use the command sudo raspi-config, selct advanced options -> Expand file system.
You can get EUI address by using these commands
ip link show eth0 - if you are using ethernet cable
ip link show wlan0 - if using router
You will get a gateway EUI use that EUI to register your gateway in The Things Network.
