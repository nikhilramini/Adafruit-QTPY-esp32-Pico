This guide gives a detailed overview of how to get started with raspberry pi 

# Product Description
Product Name: Raspberry Pi 3 
Product Description: The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the third generation Raspberry Pi. 
This powerful credit-card sized single board computer can be used for many applications and supersedes the original Raspberry Pi Model B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. 
Whilst maintaining the popular board format the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B brings you a more powerful processer, 10x faster than the first generation Raspberry Pi. 
Additionally it adds wireless LAN & Bluetooth connectivity making it the ideal solution for powerful connected designs.

# Installation
Begin with the raspberry OS installation. Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager. 
Use this link to https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ (or) https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/ download
Open the raspberry pi imager application select choose device and select the device you are using(select the model). 
Choose the OS, choose storage(sd card). You can also edit the settings like username and password
(You can also change them later through command line using sudo raspi-config command, but it's better to change here). 
Set the locale settings(adding time zone), now flash the os into sd card.
Now you can fix the parts. You need to insert SD card after seeting up the equipment.
For detailed information on how to fix the parts use this link https://youtu.be/DdnzSmJ5Fxg?si=YDYS_Bi70eTiWGiy. Note: This is reference for setting up the parts.
For getting started with raspberry pi follow this links https://youtu.be/aR9-gbZvBh0?si=jhLzmiA2kFvTqd6E and https://youtu.be/bea7g5isD0w?si=KTFwbOSb_EdKQ-TD
Check the description of the videos for the github links.
Follow the link below to get detailed overview https://youtu.be/bea7g5isD0w?si=n5sUUBpQowxnjzMq
Once you log in to the raspberry desktop you can use the comand sudo raspi-config to make changes to password or to set time zone and language.
As we are in US we need to select en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
On next selct screen select en_US.UTF-8. Now reboot to make the changes reflect.
df -h command gives info about the sd card storage
To increase the storage use the command sudo raspi-config, selct advanced options -> Expand file system.
You can get EUI address by using these commands
ip link show eth0 - if you are using ethernet cable
ip link show wlan0 - if using router
You will get a gateway EUI use that EUI to register your gateway in The Things Network.


# Cloning Repository

We are cloning a github repository. To clone the repository enter the command
git clone https://github.com/robertlie/RAK831-LoraGateway-RPi ~/rak831-loragateway - using CLI
https://github.com/robertlie/RAK831-LoRaGateway-RPi - Github link

After cloning use the command ls -al you should see the cloned folder rak-831loragateway.
Now go to this repository using cd rak-831loragateway use ls -al. You should see an install script.
Enter this command to execute install script sudo ./install.sh
You will see Gateway EUI. Set the configurations like region, latitude, longitude and altitude.
After install script is executed the system reboots.

Login into raspberry pi go to the folder opt i.e cd /opt then go to this folder cd /ttn-gateway
Install script installs lora_gateway and packet_forwarder packages. go to packet_forwarder i.e cd /packet_forwarder 
check the ttn-gateway status by using this command systemctl status ttn-gateway -l
This should be active and run withou errors.

Installing Global Json and Local Json

Global configuration json file is main file it contains information related to frequency, gateway EUI.
Install script installs global and local json files, but we will use different files.

now go to cd lora_pkt_fwd folder this folder contains global_conf.json file
Rename this file mv global_conf.json global_conf.json_orig

My gateway is operating in US so download this file
wget https://githubusercontent.com/TheThingsNetwork/gateway-conf/master/US-global_conf.json
After downloading this file rename this file mv US-global_conf.json global_conf.json
Reboot the raspberry pi
Check ttn-gateway server status systemctl status ttn-gateway -l there should be no errors
In the global_conf.json check all parameters and make sure that they align with your region like frequency, the region you are operating, etc.

# Adding Gateways

https://console.cloud.thethings.network/
Follow the link and click a cluster(i.e, where your gateway is operating(location) in my case it is North America nam1)

1. Go to Gateways in the top menu, and click + Register Gateway to reach the gateway registration page.

2. Fill the Gateway EUI and click Confirm. Some gateways do not use a Gateway EUI (e.g. The Things Kickstarter Gateway), in which case you can 
just click on Continue without EUI.

3. Depending on whether the Gateway EUI is claimable you will either be shown the claiming form or the manual registration form.

4. On the manual registration form fill in the Frequency Plan and the Gateway ID if it was not pre filled, The other fields are optional. 
Click Register Gateway to finish. Use the frequency United States 902-928 MHz, FSB 2 Used by TTN.

5. Your gateway will be created and you will be redirected to the gateway overview page of your newly created gateway.

# Set Gateway Location

1. Once you have added your gateway to The Things Stack, you can also set its location to be displayed on a map widget by clicking Change 
location settings.

2. If you want your gatewayâ€™s location to be publicly displayed, check the Publish location box.

3. The gateway location can be manually set by entering the Latitude, Longitude and Altitude values.

4. You can also check the Update from status messages box if you want to update the location based on the metadata from the incoming uplink 
gateway status messages. The location settings you manually entered will be overwritten by the updates from the gateway status messages.

5. Note: If you change the physical location of your gateway, the location update in The Things Stack will take place only after you restart the 
gateway.
